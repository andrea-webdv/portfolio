here is the prototype of a password generator, this webapp allow the user to create new passwords from images (jpeg or png), choosed from his/her device memory; toghether with a word related to image itself.

Thanks to this the user can avoid to memorize his/her passwords, write or memorize them anywhere:

The only thing the user should memorize is that correlated word, and oviously to keep the image into device's memory.

After the generation, the outcome password will be automatically copied in the user notes (equal to select it and press ctrl+c);
so he/she can paste the password in any other page (this hepl to avoid also any keylogger risk).

thsi is a prototype bacause s completelly developed into an front-end project; 
building of an back-end, linked to any daatabase and the split of logic between front-end and back-end will be argument of a future update.
